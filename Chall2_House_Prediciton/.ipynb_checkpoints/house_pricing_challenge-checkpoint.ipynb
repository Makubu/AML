    "This challenge is adapted from the well-known '<i>Zillow's Home Value Prediction</i>' competition on Kaggle.\n",
    "In particular, given a dataset containing descriptions of homes on the US property market, your task is to make predictions on the selling price of as-yet unlisted properties. \n",
    "Developing a model which accurately fits the available training data while also generalising to unseen data-points is a multi-faceted challenge that involves a mixture of data exploration, pre-processing, model selection, and performance evaluation.\n",

    "**IMPORTANT**: please refer to the AML course guidelines concerning grading rules. Pay especially attention to the **presentation quality** item, which boils down to: don't dump a zillion of lines of code and plots in this notebook. Produce a concise summary of your findings: this notebook can exist in two versions, a \"scratch\" version that you will use to work and debug, a \"presentation\" version that you will submit. The \"presentation\" notebook should go to the point, and convay the main findings of your work."

    "## Overview\n",
    "Beyond simply producing a well-performing model for making predictions, in this challenge we would like you to start developing your skills as a machine learning scientist.\n",
    "In this regard, your notebook should be structured in such a way as to explore the following tasks that are expected to be carried out whenever undertaking such a project.\n",
    "The description below each aspect should serve as a guide for your work, but you are strongly encouraged to also explore alternative options and directions. \n",
    "Thinking outside the box will always be rewarded in these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data preparation:\n",
    "   \n",
    "_Data exploration_: The first broad component of your work should enable you to familiarise yourselves with the given data, an outline of which is given at the end of this challenge specification. Among others, you can work on:\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Data cleaning, e.g. treatment of categorial variables;\n",
    "* Data visualisation; Computing descriptive statistics, e.g. correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Data Pre-processing_: The previous step should give you a better understanding of which pre-processing is required for the data. This may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normalising and standardising the given data;\n",
    "* Removing outliers;\n",
    "* Carrying out feature selection, possibly using metrics derived from information theory;\n",
    "* Handling missing information in the dataset;\n",
    "* Augmenting the dataset with external information;\n",
    "* Combining existing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model selection\n",
    "An important part of the work involves the selection of a model that can successfully handle the given data and yield sensible predictions. Instead of focusing exclusively on your final chosen model, it is also important to share your thought process in this notebook by additionally describing alternative candidate models. There is a wealth of models to choose from, such as decision trees, random forests, (Bayesian) neural networks, Gaussian processes, LASSO regression, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Irrespective of your choice, it is highly likely that your model will have one or more parameters that require tuning. There are several techniques for carrying out such a procedure, such as cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Performance Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation method for this challenge is the root mean squared error between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. Taking logs ensures that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will have a similar impact on the overall result."
